	a corpus of multilingual documents. We propose a multiview learning,
	co-regularization approach, in which we consider each language as
	a separate source, and minimize a joint loss that combines monolingual
	classification losses in each language while ensuring consistency
	of the categorization across languages. We derive training algorithms
	for logistic regression and boosting, and show that the resulting
	categorizers outperform models trained independently on each language,
	and even, most of the times, models trained on the joint bilingual
	data. Experiments are carried out on a multilingual extension of
	the RCV2 corpus, which is available for benchmarking.},

	that the error of our adaptation model can be bounded with respect
	to the embedded distribution gap and the empirical loss in the source

	mining problems, namely, document classification and information
	extraction to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Traditional machine learning makes a basic assumption: the training
	and test data should be under the same distribution. However, in
	many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold.
	The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain
	comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain.
	Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste
	to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel
	transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based
	learning algorithms (Freund \& Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows
	users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage
	the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for
	the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate
	model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of
	old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model
	alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively
	transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our
	algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that
	our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.},

	in dealing with both labeled and unlabeled data when these data are

	wish to make use of the labeled data from one domain (called in-domain)
	to classify the unlabeled data in a different domain (out-of-domain).
	This problem often happens when obtaining labeled data in one domain
	is difficult while there are plenty of labeled data from a related
	but different domain. In general, this is a transfer learning problem
	where we wish to classify the unlabeled data through the labeled
	data even though these data are not from the same domain. In this
	paper, we formulate this domain-transfer learning problem under a
	novel spectral classification framework, where the objective function
	is introduced to seek consistency between the in-domain supervision
	and the out-of-domain intrinsic structure. Through optimization of
	the cost function, the label information from the in-domain data
	is effectively transferred to help classify the unlabeled data from
	the out-of-domain. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our
	method and show that our algorithm achieves significant improvements

	labeled data in a source domain to solve related but different problems
	in a target domain, even when the training and testing problems have
	different distributions or features. In this paper, we consider transfer
	learning via dimensionality reduction. To solve this problem, we
	learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the distributions
	between the source domain data and the target domain data are the
	same or close to each other. Onto this latent feature space, we project
	the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning
	algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the
	latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge
	from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution
	of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method
	to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions
	of the data in different domains in a latent space. The effectiveness
	of our approach to transfer learning is verified by experiments in
	two real world applications: indoor WiFi localization and binary

	when we have 1) labeled samples of leopard and zebra and 2) unlabelled
	samples of tiger and elk at hand? Cross-domain learning algorithms
	can be used to solve the above problem. However, existing cross-domain
	algorithms cannot be applied for dimension reduction, which plays
	a key role in computer vision tasks, e.g., face recognition and web
	image annotation. This paper envisions the cross-domain discriminative
	dimension reduction to provide an effective solution for cross-domain
	dimension reduction. In particular, we propose the cross-domain discriminative
	Hessian Eigenmaps or CDHE for short. CDHE connects training and test
	samples by minimizing the quadratic distance between the distribution
	of the training set and that of the test set. Therefore, a common
	subspace for data representation can be well preserved. Furthermore,
	we basically expect the discriminative information used to separate
	leopards and zebra can be shared to separate tigers and elks, and
	thus we have a chance to duly address the above question. Margin
	maximization principle is adopted in CDHE so the discriminative information
	for separating different classes (e.g., leopard and zebra here) can
	be well preserved. Finally, CDHE encodes the local geometry of each
	training class (e.g., leopard and zebra here) in the local tangent
	space which is locally isometric to the data manifold and thus CDHE
	preserves the intraclass local geometry. The objective function of
	CDHE is not convex, so the gradient descent strategy can only find
	a local optimal solution. In this paper, we carefully design an evolutionary
	search strategy to find a better solution of CDHE. Experimental evidence
	on both synthetic and real word image datasets demonstrates the effectiveness
	of CDHE for cross-domain web image annotation and face recognition.},

  pages = {657},
  abstract = {This paper presents approaches to semi-supervised learning when the
	labeled training data and test data are differently distributed.
	Specifically, the samples selected for labeling are a biased subset
	of some general distribution and the test set consists of samples
	drawn from either that general distribution or the distribution of
	the unlabeled samples. An example of the former appears in loan application
	approval, where samples with repay/default labels exist only for
	approved applicants and the goal is to model the repay/default behavior
	of all applicants. An example of the latter appears in spam filtering,
	in which the labeled samples can be out-dated due to the cost of
	labeling email by hand, but an unlabeled set of up-to-date emails
	exists and the goal is to build a filter to sort new incoming email.Most
	approaches to overcoming such bias in the literature rely on the
	assumption that samples are selected for labeling depending only
	on the features, not the labels, a case in which provably correct
	methods exist. The missing labels are said to be "missing at random"
	(MAR). In real applications, however, the selection bias can be more
	severe. When the MAR conditional independence assumption is not satisfied
	and missing labels are said to be "missing not at random" (MNAR),
	and no learning method is provably always correct.We present a generative
	classifier, the shifted mixture model (SMM), with separate representations
	of the distributions of the labeled samples and the unlabeled samples.
	The SMM makes no conditional independence assumptions and can model
	distributions of semi-labeled data sets with arbitrary bias in the
	labeling. We present a learning method based on the expectation maximization
	(EM) algorithm that, while not always able to overcome arbitrary
	labeling bias, learns SMMs with higher test-set accuracy in real-world
	data sets (with MNAR bias) than existing learning methods that are
	proven to overcome MAR bias.},

	constructing the similarity matrix for different part of the graph.
	Among all related methods, similarity propagation approach can make
